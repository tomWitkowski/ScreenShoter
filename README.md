The project's goal is to create an app saving observed slides into a document. 
Take more attention on listening lectures, not on taking notes.

Let's show it on the example:

I opened an app and run it. 'document_dir' I wrote is a working directory with slides and a name of the output document.

I opened my presentation on full-screen mode. How the result looks like?
